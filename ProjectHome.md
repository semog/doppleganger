When developing modularized open source, sometimes it is necessary to interface to commercial software.  This commercial software may be critical to the build process of the open source software, but can not be distributed with the open source project due to licensing constraints.  **Doppleganger** is run against the commercial software assembly DLLs, and C# code is generated from the public APIs.  This C# code can then be compiled into a stub DLL that can serve as a stand-in for the open source distribution.  Users of the open-source project can then obtain their own licenses to the commercial software portion and replace the doppleganger assembly in their build environments.
